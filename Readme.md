# CRM - Customer Relationship Management System

<p>This is a simple Spring application for CRM, created using Spring MVC and Hibernate. I downloaded it from #CryptoSingh1337 and revised it to run on my laptop. If you want to see the original project, visit the following link: https://github.com/CryptoSingh1337/crm-springmvc-hibernate.</p>

### Functionality 
- CRUD operations for Customer Management.
- Search based on first name, last name and email.
- Sort the data based on first name, last name and email.
- Used Service facade and DAO design principles.
- Added bean validation on Customer properties.
- Added Spring AOP for logging (@Before and @AfterReturning advice).
